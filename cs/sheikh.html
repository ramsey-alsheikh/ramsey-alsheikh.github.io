The Sheikh can play ROMs from virtually any console from the last four decades of gaming. ROMs can be virtually loaded into the built-in emulators via USB or wirelessly.</h3>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's off the wall crazy! Or should we say, on the wall? This is The Sheikh, a gaming console that I designed and protyped independently to satisfy my love of retro-gaming and suction cups. Versatile and affordable, the Sheikh bridges the console-handheld gap in a way that no console has before.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem I observered in consoles that tried to combine handheld and home-console technology was the limitedness of the home console functionalities. With the Nintendo Switch, for example, the console is only able to be used as a home-console if you lug around the heavy port/cables with you AND happen to have access to a TV while travelling. The Sheikh solves this problem by being able to be mounted anywhere there's a smooth surface, like a window or polished wood. Plus, suction cups are cool!</p>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sheikh is fully portable - you can play on it anywhere. At the same time, it simulates the feel of a home console by being able to mount onto surfaces and act as a mini TV screen. It accomplishes this with the four suction cups on the back. When put onto a smooth surface (such as glass), they will stick and will not let go until the user decides to take it off. It can also connect to a normal TV via HDMI. The total cost to build the Sheikh is only $100 - compare that to the Switch, which is $300!</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the details, the Sheikh runs on RetroPie, a free open-source version of the popular operating system genre Linux. Specifically, it runs on the retropie kernel v4.9. RetroPie is a complete operating system that allows the user to emulate several old consoles and play the corresponding video games. The virtual console is called an emulator and the virtual video games are called ROMs. With RetroPie, you can easily (and wirelessly) transfer ROMs from a PC to the Sheikh. Afterwards, you can do anything a regular operating system can do: manage files, attach external hard drives, and of course, play video games. Connect a controller via the USB ports on the left of the Raspberry Pi, or connect a Bluetooth device into the USB ports if you wish to play wirelessly. </p>
