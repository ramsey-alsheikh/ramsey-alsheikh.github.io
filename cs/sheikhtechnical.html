			<h3 class="light">The Sheikh is a a new, affordable portable-gaming console that can mount onto smooth surfaces (eg. glass, whiteboards, smooth walls). The Sheikh can play ROMs from virtually any console from the last four decades of gaming. ROMs can be virtually loaded into the built-in emulators via USB or wirelessly.</h3>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sheikh runs on a Raspberry Pi-an affordable computer capable of doing many things. It is connected to its screen via HDMI. It runs on 5V/ 2A power. The audio circuit utilizes the Pi’s built in 3.55 mm audio output, and an audio amplifier to give the sound a boost. It uses 3W speakers. For ease of use, the Sheikh has a power switch to turn itself on and off, and it has an audio switch to turn audio on and off. This way, you can play ‘incognito’- that is, without any sounds. The audio circuit consists of a 3.7V battery, and battery charger, an audio amplifier, speakers, and a 3.55 mm wire. The power for the circuit comes from the battery. Attached to the battery is a battery charger (a device that will act as a manager for the battery, taking the power and supplying it to outputs, charging it when the user plugs a Micro USB cable, etc.). From there, power flows to a switch, allowing you to mute the device. If the switch is ON, then power goes to the audio, allowing you to listen to the sound in your game! The power for the device is supplied by a 3.7V lithium ion battery with a battery charger. The power then goes to a 5V booster, so that the Raspberry Pi gets enough power. In between the battery charger and the booster is a switch, which acts as an ON/OFF switch for the whole device. From the booster, power enters the USB port, is carried by a USB to Micro USB cable all the way to the Pi.</p>
