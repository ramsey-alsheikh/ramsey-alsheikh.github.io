			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software bloat is the inefficient or ineffective use of computer resources that affects many computer operating systems today; in particular the Linux kernel is known to suffer acutely from bloat. The purpose of this experiment was to provide evidence for whether or not the performance of the Linux kernel may be improved, and bloat reduced, through implementing SLAB memory allocation instead of SLUB, and the Multiple Queue Skiplist Scheduler (MuQSS) process scheduler instead of the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS). Both SLUB and CFS sacrifice general system efficiency for failsafes in cases with extreme RAM and CPU time utilization; thus, it was hypothesized that they were detrimental to overall system performance, relatively inefficient, and sources of software bloat. <br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hypothesis was that if SLAB allocation was enabled and the MuQSS scheduler was set up in the Linux kernel, then the performance of the computer (measured by disk space, memory usage, and processing speed), would improve. An Arch Linux system was prepared with this configuration, and it outperformed the default configuration significantly on all three trials as measured by UnixBench, a standard benchmarking program for Unix-like operating systems. This experiment provides evidence for the effectiveness of this potential bloat-reducing and performance-enhancing Linux kernel patch. Due to the importance of Linux in several key technological areas, including smartphone operating systems, web server hosting, and supercomputer processing, any reduction of bloat in the Linux kernel is of particular interest to modern computer science and operating system design.</p>
