			<h3 class="light">"Natural Computational Entropy" is a term coined by myself to refer to the inherit unpredicatbility of the internal state of a computer. Computers operate at such an incredibly fast speed, with many unique internal states that are always changing, that it is possible to use the machine itself to generate <u>true</u> random numbers.</h3>

			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Random number generation is the process of generating numbers that could not feasibly be predicted beforehand. The purpose of this experiment was to provide evidence that a computer’s local processes could be used as a source of entropy for a random number generator (RNG). The hypothesis was that the generator using natural computational entropy would produce statistically random numbers. The local CPU registers of a machine running Ubuntu were used as a source of entropy for a newly coded random number generator. These CPU registers change their contents millions of times per second, so it was hypothesized that it would be impossible to predict their contents beforehand. A C program was coded on a system running Ubuntu Linux that used the contents of the EAX register every second to output a series of 10 bit numbers.</p>
			<br>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generator passed the Dieharder suite of statistical tests, and the hypothesis was supported. While the Dieharder tests do not “prove” randomness - as randomness is technically impossible to prove - passing it indicates it is very likely that the generator is reliable. Further research is needed to conduct more exhaustive statistical tests, and to examine other potential sources of entropy in a computer that could prove to be, effectively, more random. This experiment has provided evidence for the possibility of true random number generation that does not rely on expensive equipment. It has applications in cryptography and computer security, as random numbers are commonly used to make computer interactions more secure from hackers.</p>
