			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misere Nim is a game where 2 players take turns taking at least one unit in exactly one group from groups of 1, 3, 5, and 7 units, where the player who takes the last unit loses. The purpose of this experiment was to test the effect of random moves on a Misere Nim bot’s chances of winning in a computerized game of Misere Nim. The hypothesis was if 10,000 matches of computerized misere Nim are played, a no strategy bot going second would win at least 2 times against a strategy bot going first. A program ran a bot that played strategically against a bot that played randomly in misere Nim 10,000 times. This program ran three times, and outputted a text file with the results, which was recorded. It also played Misere Nim 10,000 times against two randomly-playing bots. This round also ran three times and outputted a text file with the results, which was recorded.</p>
			<br>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game with a strategy bot resulted in the strategy bot winning on average 9999 2/3 times, and the no strategy bot winning an average of 1/3 times. The game with two no strategy bots resulted in bot 1 winning on average 5010 times. The hypothesis wasn’t supported, and the hypothesis was a severe underestimation of how many times the strategy bot would win. These results can be applied to game theory and strategic analysis, by illustrating the extent to which a strategy helps to win games. </p>
