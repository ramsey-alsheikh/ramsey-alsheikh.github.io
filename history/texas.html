			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two versions of the same article present here: one soley covering the Texas Revolution (complete) and one covering both the Texas Revolution and Mexican-American War (on hiatus). Both have useful information so I decided to put them both here. Enjoy!</p>

			<p class="italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark>"The Mexican-American War is not a famous war. Compared to the Civil War, the
Revolutionary War, or either of the World Wars, it is unknown and unimportant to many
Americans. And yet, the Mexican-American war was the first war the U.S. ever fought on
foreign soil, and the first war after the Revolution where America was the aggressor. It won more
land for America than any other war before or after it, pushing America towards the Pacific for
the first time. It was a prequel to the more widely known Civil War, where many military
veterans from the war with Mexico would go on to command both sides. Perhaps most
importantly of all, it further divided the country in a time where differences over slavery were
already tearing the nation apart. In several ways, it shaped the future of America, and by
extension, the world."</mark></p>
